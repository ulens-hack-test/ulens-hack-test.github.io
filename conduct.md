The organizers are committed to making this meeting productive and
enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or
religion. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Please follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or
  exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment
  includes sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo,
  deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of
  an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments
  related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, or religion.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
 including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
 imagery is not appropriate.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
  attendees. Critique ideas, not people.

- If participants wish to share photos or contents of talks/slides of
any attendee or speaker on social media, we ask that they first get
permission.

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to
comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers without a
refund of any charge.

Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is
asked to speak, in confidence, to **TBD man** and **TBD woman**.

This code of conduct is based on the "London Code of Conduct", as
originally designed for the conference "Accurate Astrophysics. Correct
Cosmology", held in London in July 2015.
