The 23rd Microlensing Workshop and Hack Session will be held **January
28, 2019 -- February 1, 2019 at the [Center for Computational
Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/)
in New York City**. The Workshop will be held the first 2.5 days
(Monday through Wednesday morning) including some introductory
material for the Hack Session. The last 2.5 days (Wednesday afternoon
through Friday) will be devoted to hacking.  A
[tentative schedule is available here](/schedule/).

Hack Session participants
are encouraged to attend the full week to get a fully immersive
introduction to microlensing. However, for those who are unable to
attend the full week but would still like to participate in the Hack
Session, there will be an option to attend just the Hack Session from
Wednesday -- Friday. We will endeavor to make relevant introductory
material available beforehand.

To register for the Conference (including the Hack Session), please
visit the main conference website (TBD). To receive a notification
when registration opens, please [sign up for the ulens-hack GitHub
organization](https://github.com/ulens-hack).
