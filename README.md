# CCA Microlensing Hack Week 2019

Static website for the CCA microlensing hack week, January 28, 2019 -- February 1, 2019. The source code here is automatically
converted to HTML using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) and lives at

All pages in the website are generated from Markdown (*.md) plain-text files. Please see [this link](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/779fa77e9b90fe945b0c)
for a very quick cheat sheet on the Markdown syntax.
